This is just a try to parse tex expression to sympy expression.

At the moment, there is no special method but translating functions one by one. 
The main script is Translate.py. Others define functions the script uses, which 
thus can be easily modified to parse other lanuages(maybe?)..

Please forgive me for my poor Python skills...
